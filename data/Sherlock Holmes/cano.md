**Question:** Who is the narrator of the stories, and what was his profession before meeting Sherlock Holmes?

**Question:** Since Dr. Watson had a medical degree from London, did he meet Holmes while they were both studying medicine at the hospital?
**Answer:** **No.** They were introduced by a mutual acquaintance named Stamford at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. Holmes was not a student; he was merely using the chemical laboratory for his own private researches.

**Question:** If Holmes wasn't a student, what was the specific "medico-legal discovery" he was celebrating when Watson first walked into the laboratory?
**Answer:** He had discovered a **reagent that is precipitated by hemoglobin**, providing a reliable test for bloodstains. He claimed it was the most practical medico-legal discovery in years.

**Question:** Given Holmes's vast scientific knowledge, would you say he was an expert in all academic fields, including astronomy and politics?
**Answer:** **Correction: No.** Watson was horrified to find Holmes was "profoundly ignorant" of the Solar System and contemporary literature. Holmes argued that the human brain has finite capacity and he refused to store "useless" information.

**Question:** How does Holmes typically spend his time when he is not in a "working fit" and has no active case to solve?
**Answer:** During periods of boredom, Holmes often resorted to a **"seven-per-cent solution" of cocaine**, much to Watson's dismay, or spent hours playing his Stradivarius violin.

**Question:** In "The Adventure of Black Peter," Watson finds Holmes covered in blood and carrying a harpoon; was Holmes practicing his aim for a sea voyage?
**Answer:** **No.** He had spent the morning at a butcher's shop, attempting to transfix a dead pig with a single blow of a harpoon to determine if a man of average strength could have committed the murder of Peter Carey.

**Question:** What was the primary physical clue found at the crime scene of "Black Peter" that Holmes believed the police had misinterpreted?
**Answer:** A **sealskin tobacco pouch** with the initials "P.C." was found. While the police assumed it belonged to the victim, Peter Carey, Holmes noted the tobacco inside was a strong "ship’s tobacco" that Carey did not usually smoke.
**Page:** 618

**Question:** Since the tobacco pouch was found at the scene, does that mean the police were correct in assuming no one else was in the cabin that night?
**Answer:** **Correction: No.** Holmes deduced a visitor was present because two glasses were used for rum and water, and the specific "ship’s tobacco" belonged to the mysterious visitor who had summoned Carey that night.

**Question:** In "The Adventure of the Priory School," does Holmes immediately share his findings with the police to ensure the kidnappers are caught by the law?
**Answer:** **No.** Holmes first secures his own reward. He presents his findings to the Duke of Holdernesse and accepts a check for **£12,000**, a massive sum for the time.
**Page:** 593

**Question:** Considering the high fee he charged the Duke, does Holmes work only for wealthy clients who can pay large rewards?
**Answer:** **Incorrect.** Holmes frequently takes cases from the poor or middle class for free if the problem is interesting. He told Helen Stoner that he worked for the **"love of my art"** rather than the client's wealth.
