ROBIN HOOD
1. Q: What was the man dressed in who stood behind a tree?
   A: He was dressed in a tunic made of a rough green cloth, open at the top, and showing a bronzed neck.
   Round his waist was a broad leathern girdle in which were stuck at one place a dagger,
   and at the other side three long arrows. Short breeches of soft leather covered his thighs,
   below which he wore hosen of green wool, which reached to his feet.
   The latter were encased in shoes of stout pig's leather.
