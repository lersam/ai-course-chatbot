TEENY-TINY
1. Comprehension Question
Where did the teeny-tiny woman find the bone, and what did she originally intend to do with it?

Answer: She found the bone on a grave in a churchyard and intended to use it to make soup for her supper.

2. Analytical Question
How does the teeny-tiny woman’s reaction to the voice change from the beginning of the story to the end?

Answer: 
At the beginning of the story, when the teeny-tiny woman first hears the voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard saying "Give me my bone!,"
she is a teeny-tiny bit frightened and hides her head under the teeny-tiny clothes. She goes to sleep again without responding.
However, by the end of the story, after hearing the voice multiple times and each time it getting louder,
she becomes progressively more frightened but finally decides to confront the situation.
When the voice cries out a teeny-tiny louder for the third time, she puts her head out of the clothes and says in her loudest teeny-tiny voice, “TAKE IT!”
